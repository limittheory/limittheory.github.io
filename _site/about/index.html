                <p class="feature-paragraph">The people of the Ancient Colony believed that all limits - physical, technological, even cosmological - could be overcome with the mind. "You are your only limitation," they said. It was unrealistic, perhaps even childish. But it worked. This so-called 'limit theory' thrived in the minds of the people. Idealism drove overwhelming progress. Far-fetched aspirations became concrete realities. Wide-eyed dreams fueled breakthroughs in all fields. Limit theory prevailed, and it took civilization from the surface of one planet to the farthest corners of the universe.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You are part of this great lineage of idealists. You, like your ancestors, are free of limitation. You, like your ancestors, see exploitable potential in everything around you. You, like your ancestors, are a limit theorist, and you will carve your own story in this radiant universe.</p>

                    <h2>All Things Procedural</h2><p>All of the content that populates each universe is generated by the computer, using a technique known as procedural content generation. This means that next time you start a game, not only will the universe be different - but all things therein as well, including factions, goods, weapons, ships, mission opportunities, stations, planets, AI pilots, and more. Each universe is a totally unique experience without end. </p>

Moreover, events that occur in the universe - raids, blockades, factional takeovers, and so on - may change the entire dynamic of a region's economy. Your actions are no exception. As you become more influential, you may find your operations to have a significant impact on the surrounding systems. </p>

AI players live their lives as well, and throughout your journey in the universe you will see factions fall, planets overrun, wars waged, treaties signed, and so on. Inevitably, you will cross paths many times with the NPCs trying to forge a life in the universe - for better or for worse. </p>

            <h2>Sunday, January 4, 2015</h2>
            <p>

            Hoorah! The first day of Limit Theory of the glorious year of 2^11 - 33 has come and gone :D The day consisted of a visit to the park with ye olde notebook, much time spent with the master planning tree (or, more lovingly, tree.txt), an exciting excursion into LTSL-based planning, and a bout of coding cave remodeling  :monkey: </p><p>

            I've continued to flesh out my planning tree as much as possible, especially under the gameplay sub-tree. Although I sometimes feel daunted by the size of the branches that remain marked as 'in progress' (thankfully very few branches continue to bear the dreaded 'not started' mark), I remind myself that most of the planning tree is actually marked 'complete' -- but I've not been so thorough in writing down branches that I've already completed or those that have been simultaneously created and completed in those swift bouts of midnight coding. So I took a bit of time as well to flesh out some of the branches that have already been completed before the planning tree was ever built, or those that were completed too quickly to make it into the tree. After doing so, it's rather nice to see that, indeed, many vast and 'heavy' (difficult) branches bear the honorable mark of 'complete.' Not surprisingly, 'tech,' which is one of the three top-level branches (and is appropriately-massive), is almost entirely marked complete :roll: :shifty:</p><p>

            After digging into the tree for several hours, I once again started to feel annoyed at the inadequacy of my project management tools. As I've written about before, I've tried every online project management tool under the sun. Planners, fancy to-do lists, industrial-strength team coordination tools, mind-mapping tools, etc. None of them have hit the spot just right, which is why, despite retaining a rather massive online mind-map of the LT project, I often fall back to working exclusively in the humble little tree.txt. But the thing is, with LTSL being where it is today, building small-to-medium-sized development tools is an easy and fun endeavor :geek: It only seemed natural that I should attempt to put together a quick tool to embody the master planning tree in true, interactive (and hierarchical) format. With only about an hour or so spent on it today, I can't say much yet, but am getting pretty excited, and remain optimistic that a simple, LTSL-based planning tool will be just what I need to manage the ever-growing detail of tree.txt </p><p> :crazy: 

            Other than that, I've worked to clean up my coding cave, re-arrange things for maximal coding zen, and, in general, get 2015 started with a fresh and productive atmosphere. Never before has my coding cave been as inspiring as it is today :D With Star Wars and Elder Scrolls posters aplenty and a new, higher-feng-shui furniture arrangement, it's really starting to feel like a place fitting for the completion of LT's development. I'm considering ordering an EVE online poster to complete the spacey touch :) Oh, and I'm also considering a small mini-fridge. You know, to shave some valuable time off of those trips to replenish the Diet Coke :shifty:
            </p><p>
            Happy to be back on the LT train, and with RTB hitting the tracks on Wednesday, I'm ready to drive this thing home :)</p><p>

            (Also, I went a full day without touching Wikipedia. Binge learning seems to have worked pretty effectively :sick: :lol:)</p>

            <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">When Will it be Released?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We're shooting for an <strong>early 2015</strong> release.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Will it be Online?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Multiplayer is <strong>not</strong> planned for the first release. We would love to pursue the option when the time is right, but our primary focus for now is on exploring gameplay concepts and building a fun, deep game. We feel that dealing with networking at this stage would distract from that focus. That being said, don't rule out the possibility of a Limit Theory Online in the future!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Will There be a Story/Campaign?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>No, part of the emphasis of Limit Theory is the <strong>lack</strong> of a story/campaign! Now, that's not to say that you won't have anything to do in game. There are plenty of missions, quests, and "stories" going on inside LT, if you're the type that likes missions and such.  Of course, they are all procedurally generated. You can take part in plenty of epic "stories," but there is no "main" story to guide you through the universe. That's up to you to craft!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Will it be Realistic?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Yes and no. Our focus is on enjoyability and fun gameplay. We certainly want it to feel more like a space simulator than an arcade game, but we won't implement features that we think aren't interesting solely for the sake of realism. Much of our philosophy can be summed up as "stylistic, not realistic." In other words, we wish to achieve a very pleasing and interesting "stylized" depiction of space, both graphically and in gameplay. Still, rest assured that we will <strong>never</strong> use this as an excuse for not polishing a feature, or implementing something poorly!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Will There be Seamless Space-to-Planet Transitions?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Not likely in the first release. We'll certainly prioritize this technology for future releases, as we feel that, in the long run, it's an absolute necessity for this genre. However, our focus for the first release is on compelling gameplay, which may, at times, come at
            the expense of graphical ammenities.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">What Engine Does it Use?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We've written a custom engine from scratch using c++ and OpenGL.  Having an intimate knowledge and control over the engine has
            allowed us to design it from the ground up to most efficiently support the level of procedural content generation
            that Limit Theory calls for. We're also just crazy enthusiastic about game engine and graphics engine design...so it seemed like
            the natural choice!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">How Will it be Distributed?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We'd like to distribute via Steam and Desura. If that plan fails, we'll revisit another distributions scheme when the time comes.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">What's With All the Fog in the Screenshots?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>It's not fog, it's dust from asteroid fields.  And no, not all systems are like that!  In fact, most space that you fly in won't be dusty.  But it turns out that we really like the dusty aesthetic, so we tend to take most of our screenshots in dense asteroid fields :) Sorry!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Can I BETA Test it?</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Maybe so! We'll post information about BETA access on the forums when the time comes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
          <h2 class="title">Procedural Ships? Space Stations? Not Possible.</h2>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We realize that there are an enormous number of misconceptions circulating concerning this still-embryonic technology known as <strong>procedural content generation</strong> (PCG). Many people think that PCG is strictly capable of such things as "fractal" terrains, vegetation, and so forth.  But PCG is <strong>not</strong> inherently tied to any particular type of content, it just happens to be quite easy to write algorithms that generate terrains and vegetation. Procedural ships and space stations, however, are completely feasible. They just require different kinds of algorithms. As you can see from the screenshots, we have had a fair amount of success already! We don't even have a 3D modeling package installed on our dev machines. We couldn't model something manually if we wanted to. We're serious when we say that <strong>everything</strong> will be procedural...and if you don't believe it, then you'll just have to get a copy of the game when it comes out and see for yourself!</p>

            <p>It totally depends on the algorithms. Procedural content can be as varied and interesting as the developer allows it to be. We are pouring an enormous amount of work into making our algorithms as diverse and high-quality as possible. We hope to achieve a level of quality and diversity that would be unattainable even by a full team of professional artists. We know that it's possible - we just have to make it happen.</p>
